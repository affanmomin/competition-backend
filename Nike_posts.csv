"For almost 50 years, Nike’s made magic by taking the most basic of elements — air — and optimizing it to help athletes perform at their peak. Now, the company’s hit a new milestone in innovation, this time in materials: Nike Radical AirFlow, debuted in this summer’s trail running season. 

Building on a rich legacy in performance apparel, Nike scientists, designers and developers asked how they could create apparel that harnesses air around a runner in motion to help keep them cool. 

""We were interested in a material that could accelerate the velocity of airflow to skin and help speed up that evaporative cooling process,” says Jahan Behbahany, Senior Director, Nike Apparel Innovation. ""We knew we had the people, the tools and the resources to develop it.""

"For our 2025 interns, the summer at NIKE, Inc. ended with a sprint to the finish.

That finish line was marked by the day each intern completed and presented their individual project to Nike leadership. It was the moment when months of innovation and hustle came together — and the 2025 class delivered.

“The interns of this year were incredible to see — defining a new ‘gold standard’ for what it looks like to be at Nike,”  says Andrew Roddam, Director, Supply Chain Innovation. “Interns this year came with a critical-thinking lens to focus on big problems, all while using their unique styles to propose solutions. I was especially impressed with seeing how they brought their stories to life, using great storytelling to drive their point home.”

Next summer, it could be you. Explore opportunities: https://lnkd.in/gwmt4NzK

"Empowering athletes through information. That goal is at the heart of NSRL Form, the Nike Sport Research Lab’s latest movement-analysis tool. It’s not just a runner’s tool. It’s a running tool, designed to study your whole body in motion, giving you the self-awareness you need in order to become a more efficient runner. 
 
As the track and field world descends on Tokyo, the newly opened Nike Harajuku will debut NSRL Form to our Japanese athletes, helping them understand their one-of-one running profiles. Chikanori Kawaguchi, Nike’s first ever retail Running Professional and based in Nike Harajuku, will lead the NSRL Form service and bring the insights of the Nike Sport Research Lab to the local area.
 
""In Japan, running is not just a sport, but a way of life,” says Kawaguchi. “It’s only right that Nike serves our runners here through premium product and services like NSRL Form. It’s a privilege to be able to do this. As an avid runner myself, I’m excited to help Japan’s runners better know themselves.”

"And that’s a wrap in Tokyo. For the last week and a half, the Japan National Stadium has hosted 60,000-strong sell-out crowds as the globe’s best track and field athletes competed for the title of World Champion. Whether you sat in the stands or watched from home, Japan’s devoted fandom for the sport was undeniable.

That energy carried through the newly opened doors of Nike Harajuku, as fans arrived inspired by the championship meet. In the middle of the action was Shiraishi Tomoki, Director of Retail Marketing, Japan, who worked tirelessly to prepare for Nike Harajuku’s opening on September 11, right before the meet began. Whether he was helping develop the store’s communication plan or perfecting the store’s Nike By You experience, Tomoki-san was in the middle of the action.

The effort was well worth the work, says Tomoki-san. He called the store opening his favorite Nike moment. The camaraderie he felt with his teammates as they created an unforgettable experience for track fans proved that a project like this really does take an entire village.

“It wasn’t just about opening a store,” says Tomoki-san. “It was about setting a moment to create energy and excitement for the brand. We all saw the responsibility we had in making this the best experience possible for our visitors. Whenever you work on a project with your teammates here, you know that you’re working with like-minded people, doing whatever it takes to create something special.”
