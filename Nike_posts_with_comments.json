Her influence is genuine, but you harness it to sell shoes. You do not elevate the spirit of sport; you subjugate it to the law of value.\n\nThe true \"future of women's basketball\" will not be shaped by a logo, but by the players seizing the means of production‚Äîclaiming ownership of their leagues, their likeness, and the value their collective labor generates.\n\nThis is not empowerment.

For the last week and a half, the Japan National Stadium has hosted 60,000-strong sell-out crowds as the globe‚Äôs best track and field athletes competed for the title of World Champion. Whether you sat in the stands or watched from home, Japan‚Äôs devoted fandom for the sport was undeniable.\n\nThat energy carried through the newly opened doors of Nike Harajuku, as fans arrived inspired by the championship meet. In the middle of the action was Shiraishi Tomoki, Director of Retail Marketing, Japan, who worked tirelessly to prepare for Nike Harajuku‚Äôs opening on September 11, right before the meet began. Whether he was helping develop the store‚Äôs communication plan or perfecting the store‚Äôs Nike By You experience, Tomoki-san was in the middle of the action.\n\nThe effort was well worth the work, says Tomoki-san. He called the store opening his favorite Nike moment. The camaraderie he felt with his teammates as they created an unforgettable experience for track fans proved that a project like this really does take an entire village.\n\n‚ÄúIt wasn‚Äôt just about opening a store,‚Äù says Tomoki-san. ‚ÄúIt was about setting a moment to create energy and excitement for the brand. We all saw the responsibility we had in making this the best experience possible for our visitors. Whenever you work on a project with your teammates here, you know that you‚Äôre working with like-minded people, doing whatever it takes to create something special.‚Äù\n\nRelive the energy in Tokyo at https://lnkd.in/gSe7B_kK",
