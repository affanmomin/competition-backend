You speak of \"empowering the next generation,\" yet this is merely the reproduction of the same ideological apparatus: convincing young women that their liberation lies not in collective struggle, but in the individualistic pursuit of becoming a branded athlete for Nike.\n\nHer exceptional athletic power is real, but you convert it into surplus value. Her influence is genuine, but you harness it to sell shoes. You do not elevate the spirit of sport; you subjugate it to the law of value.\n\nThe true \"future of women's basketball\" will not be shaped by a logo, but by the players seizing the means of production—claiming ownership of their leagues, their likeness, and the value their collective labor generates.\n\nThis is not empowerment. It is the spectacle. You offer the image of revolution while reinforcing the tyranny of capital.\n\n\nhashtag\n#GlitchTheGrind"

Students are going to use a Jordan Nike Air template and restyle these iconic trainers according to their taste. Therefore, they’ll be using a lot of creativity and inspiration and following some social themes such as: environment protection, a safe world, save the ocean, no guns, every life matters, anti racism themes, the right for education, more peace no war, a sustainable world, ... They'll have a pitch at their design acording to the template and theme explored. The students would love to submit their designs to your creative departement. \nWe’ll be holding an art exibhition at school, calling everyone’s attention on these themes and we’d be so thrilled to share it with you!\nCan you help us? How can we get this done? Who shall we contact? Looking forward to your response. \n\nBest regards,"

For the last week and a half, the Japan National Stadium has hosted 60,000-strong sell-out crowds as the globe’s best track and field athletes competed for the title of World Champion. Whether you sat in the stands or watched from home, Japan’s devoted fandom for the sport was undeniable.\n\nThat energy carried through the newly opened doors of Nike Harajuku, as fans arrived inspired by the championship meet. In the middle of the action was Shiraishi Tomoki, Director of Retail Marketing, Japan, who worked tirelessly to prepare for Nike Harajuku’s opening on September 11, right before the meet began. Whether he was helping develop the store’s communication plan or perfecting the store’s Nike By You experience, Tomoki-san was in the middle of the action.\n\nThe effort was well worth the work, says Tomoki-san. He called the store opening his favorite Nike moment. The camaraderie he felt with his teammates as they created an unforgettable experience for track fans proved that a project like this really does take an entire village.\n\n“It wasn’t just about opening a store,” says Tomoki-san. “It was about setting a moment to create energy and excitement for the brand. We all saw the responsibility we had in making this the best experience possible for our visitors. Whenever you work on a project with your teammates here, you know that you’re working with like-minded people, doing whatever it takes to create something special.”\n\nRelive the energy in Tokyo at https://lnkd.in/gSe7B_kK",
