    "Post": "Tesla is at a critical inflection point. We need your vote ahead of our 2025 Annual Meeting on November 6. \n\nTesla shareholders, the owners of our company, will soon receive their control numbers and voting instructions from their brokers. This will enable you to vote.\n\nWe are asking you to vote with the Board’s recommendations on *all* proposals.\n \nTesla is on the precipice of another massive wave of transformational growth, as demonstrated by the unveiling of our Master Plan Part IV. If you believe, like us, that \n@ElonMusk\n is the CEO that can make this ambitious vision a reality, vote your shares.\n\n\nhttp://\nvotetesla.com",
