I'm not logged in in that browser, so I cannot use Google OAuth. When trying to use the email with a one-time code, after log in it doesn't actually open back the app and it stays inside the built-in browser. There is a button in the bottom to go back to the app, but it's easy to miss. I tried three times before I could finally log in.",1,"August 5, 2025",Thanks for flagging; you definitely shouldn't be brought to the built-in browser after successfully logging in. We've filed a bug for this so we can take a closer look.

Also sometimes the comments and other changes/actions are not syncing to the server instantly even if the network connection is stable. The sync status should always be shown somewhere on all the pages. Or there should be an alert message coming on top that sync is pending. If possible please give pull to refresh on every screens. Thank you. I hope my review will help. I really like Liner ü´∂üèª,1,"January 22, 2025","Hi Rutvik, thanks for the feedback!

The redirect to the browser to log in works but, after logging in, there is no redirect back to the app which means no possibility to log into the app. Without actually building a proper login flow into the app and scrapping that poor redirect experience, this app is unusable.",0,"November 11, 2024","Hi Marko, I'm sorry login isn't working for you.
